# OilMeter

Measure the oil consumption via the burner status LED on a ESP8266 with a TCS34725 or APDS9960 color sensor.
BOM is just ~10 Euro for all parts. This project is in active development and NOT FULLY FINISHED yet!

## Oilmeter comes with the following features included:
- First start as AccessPoint (OilMeter, PWD: OilMeter), after saving Wifi-Settings it will connect to default Wifi.
- Nice handmade and Mobile-friendly Webinterface for configuration and status with live streaming updates via web-events.
- Reads the sensor status (Preheat, Blower start, burn, error and off) based on predefined color-ranges and calculates oil-consumption
  by the definition of L/h of your heater.
- MQTT-Connection with Homeassistant: Publishes status to a MQTT-Broker and automatically creates entities in Homeassistant.
- Updates on the fly with direct Firmware Uploads (powered by ElegantOTA).
- existing Sensor adapter plates can be 3D-Printed.

## Notes

If you have problems with ESP-restarts please consider that the burner needs a high voltage to start burning.
This high voltage can be transmitted via the wires and causes the ESP to restart. To avoid this you can take a foil
(or some tabac-box) to isolate the esp and network cables to isolate the sensor wires. Make sure you put the isolation material with
a extra-wire to any ground in your house.

To make good measures you need to know the actual tank volume. You can do this by estimate based on the height of the oil in the tank
or you start from scratch if the tank is filled up to its maximum. After the first refill you can adapt your values based on whats 
really used vs. whats refilled.

#Todo

- Multicolor LED for sensor status and system messages
- feedback if setting was saved.
- do not send messages if MQTT is not connected.
- auto adaptation of the correct factor value on fill-up (needs to be between 2 times full)
- Informations about last update in the webinterface to make sure ESP is alive.
- Burning interval with decimal places (just 100 minutes is too less - like 100.01)
- Burn settings â€“ calculation factor from L to kW Heating power for Homeassistant Energy Dashboard.
- Don't save actual tank volume in burn settings (exlude all changing files in usage.json)
  - actual tank volume in liter and percent - maybe with animated svg-picture.
  - Full burning runtime
  - Full consumption in liter and kWh
  - last burn runtime
  - last interval time
  - daily times/consumption.
  - last consumption in liter and kWh
- Show system runtime and reboot cause in webinterface.
- compress webpages and js with compressors and gzip before uploading.
- webpages based on local bootstrap.
- MQTT-Homeassistant optimizations and more values.
